**Hello** _World_.

This is _**markdown**_

[chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool

I also use [Google](https://www.google.com)

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

Name    |Age       |Superpower    |Coolness
---     |---       |---           |---   
Batman  |30        |Rich          |VERY

To make a list we can use the following:

* This is item one
* This is item two
    * This is a subpoint in this list

- This is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one
2. This is item two
    - This is a **subpoint** under two
4. This is _item_ three

# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quotes

It is useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines

> * This is the second part of the blockquote
